# Test Folder

This folder contains automated unit and integration tests using **JUnit** and **Mockito**.

- The tests are designed to validate the core logic of the application.
- An **H2 in-memory database** is used to isolate tests from the production database.
- Each test can be executed independently and does not affect real data.

This setup ensures a clean and repeatable testing environment for backend logic.
